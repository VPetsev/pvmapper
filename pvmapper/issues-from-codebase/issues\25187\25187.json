    "Description": "Currently, when folks \"Register for updates\" their email address goes to a google doc, and nothing else occurs.\n\nWe need to develop the rules associated with sending updates to these folks.  One example rule could be \"when a new version is released.\"\n\nThen we need some mechanism that will automatically send the updates to the entire list.  Additionally, the update messages need an \"opt out\" mechanism.",
