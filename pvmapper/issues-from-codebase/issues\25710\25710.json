    "Description": "PV Mapper doesn't work on Internet Explorer 9.\n\nFirst it shows a warning that IndexedDB is not available, which will forbid any local storage. This wasn't an issue when IndexedDB only stored local KML files, which users could re-add during their next session. However, IndexDB now stores all local configuration. Is there a polyfill or other backward compatible partial fix for storing this configuration data on IE9?\n\nSecond, after the warning popup, no scoreboard appears. I assume this is directly related to the IndexedDB issue, which may be preventing tools from running correctly. No errors were shown in the console. It may be a separate issue, but it will also need to be fixed to support IE9.",
