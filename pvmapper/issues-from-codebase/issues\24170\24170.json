    "Description": "When the scores and values are being calculated when the page refreshes, it takes 1:13 mins to get the code for the utility edit box to show. Upon further investigation it appears that all the urls  for the tools that are fetching server data for calculation seem to be executing syncronously instead of async. Page load times must be reduced and the scripts/events need to be used/fetched async.",
