Instead of downloading massive amounts of data from OSM servers, this module sends out a query to the servers to get an OSM file for the Sub Stations in the search region(Based on SNL module). Then this OSM is converted to geo json and distance to the closest Sub Station is calculated. \r\n\r\nMe and Justin discussed about the two possibilities, one having to load the data on the server, which is possible but then causes us to use our own server, uses storage and also might contain outdated data until we run additional scripts everyday(or so) to get the latest data from OSM servers. This was the second possibility and it leverages the powerful API that OSM has already built in around which most of the OSM applications are built. ",
