    "Description": "Create a tool that can calculate the setback polygon for a site. The tool must have an input that will get the setback distance from the user. The tool will create a new layer that will have the setback polygon. The layer must not have a highly visible fill (no more than 50% opacity???) as it might cover other tool's markers. However the line can be solid and completely opaque. Styling should make sense.",
