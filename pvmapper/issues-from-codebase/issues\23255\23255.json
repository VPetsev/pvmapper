    "Description": "A site finder function allows the user to look at a large scale US map and identify potential “hot spots” for utility scale solar power development. \nRequired Data: National level solar “insolation”, slope, public lands\nPre-Condition: User choses the “Site Locator” mode or large scale (USA) map.\nUse Case:\n·         User activates the function/plugin\n·         Map highlights areas with the highest solar potential\n·         User zooms to areas of interest for higher detail views.\nFunctional Requirements: \n·         PVMapper will display a map of the United States with highlighted areas showing good potential for solar development.\nPerformance Requirements: \n·         We expect these data to be pre-computed and hence response should be very fast.",
