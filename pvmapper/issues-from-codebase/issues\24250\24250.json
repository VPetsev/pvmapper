    "Description": "Slope and aspect are interreelated values, and as such a two-dimensional utility surface is required to property score them. For example, a north-facing aspect has a very different meaning when the slope is 6 degrees and 0 degrees, and a 6 degree slope has a different meaning when it faces north or west. Create a custom score utility function for these tools which can account for this. Bonus points if it can also account for changing utility as a function of site latitude, for example a 2 degree southern facing site has different utility when closer to or further from the equator.",
