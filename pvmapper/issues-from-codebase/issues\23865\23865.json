      "Message": "Brant and I took a look at this today. We made some progress, and Brant is continuing that progress. It seems that the latest version of mongodb included a new authentication scheme, which appharbor adopted, but which our software was not participating in. Brant is in the process of upgrading the c# mongo driver, the latest version of which has the up-to-date authentication scheme.",
