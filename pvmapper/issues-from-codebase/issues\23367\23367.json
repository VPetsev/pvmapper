It is an economic assessment of the cost of the energy-generating system including all the costs over its lifetime: initial investment, \n            operations and maintenance, cost of fuel, cost of capital, and is very useful in calculating the costs of generation from different sources. \n            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source }\n \n                     Generate a random number between the min and max for each site that the user creates\n                      min:  100     target: 144   max: 200  slope: 50   type: less is better\n \n   IRR {After-tax Internal Rate of Return: You can think of IRR as the rate of growth a project is expected to generate.
