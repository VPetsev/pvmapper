      "Message": "Associated with changeset 71419: Power line tool is in and working; we now have several functional scoring tools. Jsonp requests are working (in one module against one server), so we can start migrating away from the proxy if we need to. Lots of changes, bugfixes, cleaning and revamping. Migrated tsindex into the regular index, as things seem rather (fairly?) stable. Good news all around.",
