      "Message": "Associated with changeset 72731: Set the new Identify tool to use the Proxy. Also, I found yet another niggling difference between WMS implemented by Geoserver and ArcGIS Server. The GetFeatureInfo request can include a MIME type for the value returned. But Geoserver and ArcGIS seem to support no common format, aside from (amazingly) text/HTML. We could either A) use a hack to request the right format for the server type, or B) use a hack to parse the returned HTML. I've included a start/draft for option B. Note that neither option is terrific.",
