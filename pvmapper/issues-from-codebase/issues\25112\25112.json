      "Message": "Tested on IE 9 emulator and it seems to be running just fine.  I don't have any way of testing using the actual IE-9.  \r\n\r\n\n \nHowever, there is another bigger problem with IE-9.  The utility function window is completely shock under IE-9.  It seems the load on demand doesn't work on IE9.  If I preload the Jsxgraph.js in the Index file, Chrome doesn't work right and make everything super slow in both IE11 and Chrome.   Event IE10 didn't load the JsgGraph.js right. I say minimum support is IE11. Beside all project and custom KML support require HTML5 and its fully implemented in IE11.",
