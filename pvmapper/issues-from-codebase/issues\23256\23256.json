    "Description": "The highest priority issue for solar developers is whether they will be able to sell power once the site is developed.   A list of available utilities and other utility-scale power purchasers, contact information and specifications associated with transmission will be provided to help developers make this determination. The functionality described here is contingent on availability of power purchaser data. The system will be constructed such that these data can be added as they become available.",
