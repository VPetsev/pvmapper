    "Description": "This will allow users to run the program right away, without having to register (which can certainly be tedious). Their changed should be saved to a temporary user account. There should be a Register button in the top right someplace, (instead of Log Out) which will allow the temporary user account to be upgraded to a perminant user, retaining all of their edits. Also, we'll need to decide on a retention policy for temporary account info (manually delete them with a script, or regularly delete them based on a last login time, or something?)",
