    "ClosedComment": "ESRI has pulled their slope, aspect, and elevation layers. This might be related to their upcoming World Elevation Service (currently in Beta; see http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//009t00000244000000). A brief search didn't find a suitable replacement for these data sources, so I've disabled the tool at present. Hopefully the new slope tool can be expanded to include aspect and elevation data, as appropriate.",
