Suppose that a developer creates a tool that has a useful function, but along\r\n side that function, the tool also sends the sites information back to his servers. This would in effect mean that that dev would have access to any and all information the user enters into the system.</p>\r\n<p>How are we going to prevent that?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Can we sandbox the code coming from outside devs? </li><li>Do we review all tools before making them available to the public? </li><li>Are we going to take responsibility for ensuring that the JS doesn't behave badly?\r\n</li></ul>\r\n",
